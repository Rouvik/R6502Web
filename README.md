# R6502Web
This is a clone of the original R6502 C++ emulator at https://github.com/Rouvik/R6502.git
this project is a port of the emulator to web along with a assembler and a proper code editor to write, assemble, and run programs
from the browser seamlessly.

# Notable dependencies:
- asm6 Assembler by parasyte from https://github.com/parasyte/asm6.git [Also note, I did make some minor modifications to suit my purpose]
- Ace code editor

# Features list (From original R6502):
- Support for all basic MOS 6502 instructions
- Support for illegal MOS 6502 instructions (JAM, TSB, ORA, ASL, ...)
- Improved timing and accurate emulation
- Decoupled system makes it easier to integrate in other projects
